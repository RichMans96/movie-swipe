Display a single movie, if liked then store movie into an array and move onto next movie. if disliked, move onto next movie.

To start, i think it would be easiest to have a genre selection as the api used doesn't seem to have a way to display movies without knowing their movie ID, but if displaying by genre, a list of movies in that genre is returned and that list can be altered depending on how you sort it.
